So I met with one of the technology gurus, [Richard Stallman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman), the founder of GNU and [Free Software Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation) a couple of times during my stay at Boston.

First, I met him on 17th October 2017, at Northeastern University, where he spoke about FSF, [Free Software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software_movement), GNU and software freedom in general.
I believe, most people in the hall were well aware of the topic(s) and yet the room was packed with students, many of who spent the entire talk standing due to his popularity and respect.

He ended the talk in his [Saint IGNUcius](http://www.stallman.org/saint.html) avatar from the [Church of Emacs](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ChurchOfEmacs).

I managed to get his autograph on my System76 machine that day.

Next, I met RMS at MIT, during [LibrePlanet 2018](https://libreplanet.org/2018/) on March 24, 2018. It was my first LibrePlanet and surely was interesting to say the least. I got to hear about the State of Onion ( Tor network ), Free and Open Source Software at Universities, the Puri.sm team, among many other things.
